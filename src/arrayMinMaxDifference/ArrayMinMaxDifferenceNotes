PROMPT:

Create a function that takes an array and returns the difference between the biggest and smallest numbers.

ELEMENTS:

1) int[] numbers
2) Arrays.sort(numbers)

MY THOUGHTS:

I'll use the utils.Array features to sort the array, and then return the int difference.

PROTOTYPE:

public int differenceMaxMin(int[] inputArray) {
	int[] sortedArray = inputArray; // A local int[] instance because I'm not sure if sorting on the inputArray will work the way I want.
	return (sortedArray[sortedArray.length-1] - sortedArray[0]);
}

POST ACTIVITY THOUGHTS:

I did use the Arrays.sort() method, but then went back and implemented a nested for loop to sort the array manually.
When the manual sort is called, the array is printed in ascending order while being sorted, and the difference is printed to console.
