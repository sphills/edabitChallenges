PROMPT:

Write a function that returns true if two rooks can attack each other, and false otherwise.



ELEMENTS:

1) canCapture(String[] rookPlacements)
2) String reader

MY THOUGHTS:

My first thought, off the back of having just completed getWordCount, is to read in the String[], break out the characters in each String[] element
as String and int, and compare the first String or first int to the second String or second int.

PROTOTYPE:

	public static boolean canCapture(String[] rooks) {
		String firstString;
		int firstInt;
		
		String secondString;
		int secondInt;
		
		for (int i = 0; i < rooks.length; i++) {
			switch (i) {
				case 0:
					firstString = Character.toString(rooks[i].charAt(0));
					firstInt = Character.getNumericValue(rooks[i].charAt(1));
					break;
				case 1:
					secondString = Character.toString(rooks[i].charAt(0));
					secondInt = Character.getNumericValue(rooks[i].charAt(1));
					break;
		}
		
		// This should've read 'if (firstString.equals(secondString)', I forgot and treated it like a primitive
		if (firstString == secondString || firstInt == secondInt) {
			return true;
		} else {
			return false;
		}
	}

POST-ACTIVITY THOUGHTS:

My method is pretty long-winded, so I enjoyed reading this top-voted solution:

	"public static boolean canCapture(String[] rooks) {
		return ((rooks[0].charAt(0) == rooks[1].charAt(0)) || 
						(rooks[0].charAt(1) == rooks[1].charAt(1)));
	}"
	
It makes sense, I'm just not a practiced code golfer so I never think about how to jam everything together.
Nice and tidy!
