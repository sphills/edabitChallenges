PROMPT:

Create a function that converts 12-hour time to 24-hour time or vice versa. Return the output as a string.

	Examples:
		convertTime("12:00 am") -> "0:00"
		convertTime("6:20 pm") -> "18:20"
		convertTime("21:00") -> "9:00 pm"
		convertTime("5:05") -> "5:05 am"
		
	Notes:
		A 12-hour time input will be denoted with an am or pm suffix.
		A 24-hour time input contains no suffix.

ELEMENTS:

1) String.substring(x, y)
2) public static String convertTime(String inputTime)
  2a) String inputHour = "";
  2b) String returnTime = "";
  2c) String returnTimeSuffix = "";
3) Integer.valueOf()

MY THOUGHTS:

So, my thought is to loop through the string and look for a suffix. If there's a suffix, it's a 12- to 24-hour conversion. If not, 24- to 12-hour.
Then, get the substring from 0 to the colon (exclusive), convert to int, do math, return value.

PROTOTYPE:

public static String convertTime(String inputTime) {

	int inputHour = 0;
	int timeFlag = 0;
	String returnTime = "";
	String returnTimeSuffix = "";
	String[] deconstructedTime = inputTime.split(":", 2);
	
	if ((inputTime.contains("a")) || (inputTime.contains("p"))) {
		if (inputTime.substring((inputTime.length() - 2), (inputTime.length() - 1)).equals("a")) {
			if (deconstructedTime[0] == 12) {
				inputHour = 0;
			} else {
				inputHour = Integer.valueOf(deconstructedTime[0]);
			}
			break;
		} else if (inputTime.substring((inputTime.length() - 2), (inputTime.length() - 1)).equals("p")) {
			inputHour = Integer.valueOf(deconstructedTime[0]) + 12;
			break;
		}
	} else {
		inputHour = Integer.valueOf(deconstructedTime[0]);
		timeFlag = 1;
		
		if (inputHour > 12) {
			inputHour -= 12;
			returnTimeSuffix = " pm";
		} else if (inputHour == 12) {
			returnTimeSuffix = " pm";
		} else {
			returnTimeSuffix = " am";
		}
	}
	
	switch (timeFlag) {
		case 0:
			returnTime = inputHour + ":" + deconstructedTime[1];
			break;
		case 1:
			returnTime = inputHour + ":" + deconstructedTime[1] + returnTimeSuffix;
			break;
	}
	
	return returnTime;
}

POST ACTIVITY THOUGHTS:

I've finally got it up and working with some notable changes:

1) The two ints I was using to store values originally have now been entirely replaced
	by the String[] deconstructedTime variable being mutated to give the desired result.

2) I realized the switch was unnecessary and the desired effect could be achieved by simply including the code within it
	in the relevant if{} or else if {} statement, so some lines were saved there.
	
3) I shortened the first "if" statement by 33% from 12 lines to 8
