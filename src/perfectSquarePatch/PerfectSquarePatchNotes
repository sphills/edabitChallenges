PROMPT:

Create a function that takes an integer and outputs an n x n square solely consisting of the integer n.

ELEMENTS:

1) an int perfectSquare[][]
2) a public method that returns perfectSquare[][]

MY THOUGHTS:

This seems simple enough, despite being about a 2D array. The class will have an instance variable of perfectSquare[][],
and when the squarePatch() method is called, the array will be created and filled, then returned upon completion.

PROTOTYPE:

public class PerfectSquarePatch {

	int squarePatch[][];
	
	public int[][] squarePatch(int inputInteger) {
		squarePatch = new int[inputInteger][inputInteger];
				
		for (int i = 0; i < inputInteger; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < inputInteger; j++) {
				squarePatch[i][j] = inputInteger;
			}
		}
		
		return squarePatch;
	}
}
