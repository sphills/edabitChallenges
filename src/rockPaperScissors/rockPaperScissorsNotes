PROMPT:

Create a function which simulates the game "rock, paper, scissors". The function takes the input of both players (rock, paper or scissors), first parameter from first player, second from second player. The function returns the result as such:

"Player 1 wins"
"Player 2 wins"
"TIE" (if both inputs are the same)
The rules of rock, paper, scissors, if not known:

Both players have to say either "rock", "paper" or "scissors" at the same time.
Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beat paper.

	Examples:
		rps("rock", "paper") ➞ "Player 2 wins"
		
		rps("paper", "rock") ➞ "Player 1 wins"
		
		rps("paper", "scissors") ➞ "Player 2 wins"
		
		rps("scissors", "scissors") ➞ "TIE"
		
		rps("scissors", "paper") ➞ "Player 1 wins"
	Notes:
		There are several ways to solve this challenge.

ELEMENTS:

1) String.equals()
2) Equality/Relational/Conditional Operators
3) public static String rps(String player1, String player2) 

MY THOUGHTS:

There's an easy if (player1.equals(player2)) { return "TIE"; } that'll handle the ties, but I'm still deciding how to handle actual comparison
between inputs. Do I want to map the input to numbers? I don't want to *nest if {} else if {} statements...

PROTOTYPE:

public static String rps(String player1, String player2) {
	int rockValue = 0;
	int paperValue = 0;
	int scissorsValue = 0;
	int player1Value = 0;
	int player2Value = 0;
	String winResult = "";
	
	if (player1.equals(player2)) {
		winResult = "TIE";
	} else {
		switch (player1.toLowerCase()) {
			case "rock":
				paperValue = 1;
				scissorsValue = -1;
				break;
			case "paper":
				scissorsValue = 1;
				rockValue = -1;
				break;
			case "scissors":
				rockValue = 1;
				paperValue = -1;
				break;
			default:
				System.out.println("The value entered for Player 1 wasn't 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors'. Please only enter 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors'.");
		}
		
		switch (player2.toLowerCase()) {
			case "rock":
				player2Value = rockValue;
				break;
			case "paper":
				player2Value = paperValue;
				break;
			case "scissors":
				player2Value = scissorsValue;
				break;
			default:
				System.out.println("The value entered for Player 2 wasn't 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors'. Please only enter 'rock,' 'paper,' or 'scissors'.");
			}
			
		if (player1Value > player2Value) {
			winResult = "Player 1 wins";
		} else if (player1Value < player2Value) {
			winResult = "Player 2 wins";
		}
	}
	
	return winResult;
}
