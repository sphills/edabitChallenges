PROMPT:

Create a program that converts a phone number with letters to one with only numbers.

	Number	Letter
	0	none
	1	none
	2	ABC
	3	DEF
	4	GHI
	5	JKL
	6	MNO
	7	PQRS
	8	TUV
	9	WXYZ
	
	Examples:
		textToNum("123-647-EYES") ➞ "123-647-3937"
		
		textToNum("(325)444-TEST") ➞ "(325)444-8378"
		
		textToNum("653-TRY-THIS") ➞ "653-879-8447"
		
		textToNum("435-224-7613") ➞ "435-224-7613"
		
	Notes:
		All inputs will be formatted as a string representing a proper phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX or (XXX)XXX-XXXX, using numbers and capital letters.
		Check the Resources tab for more info on telephone keypads.

ELEMENTS:

1) For loop
2) Switch
3) String.substring
4) String concatenation
5) public static String textToNum(String inputPhoneNumber)

MY THOUGHTS:

Take the String inputPhoneNumber and loop through all of the substrings. If the current substring is a letter,
switch on inputPhoneNumber.substring(x, y) and add a number to the String integerPhoneNumber. If it's anything else, just add that substring
value to integerPhoneNumber.

PROTOTYPE:

public static String textToNum(String inputPhoneNumber) {
	String integerPhoneNumber = "";
	String decodedString = "";
	
	for (int i = 0; i < inputPhoneNumber.length(); i++) {
		switch (inputPhoneNumber.substring(i, i + 1).toLowerCase()) {
			case "a": case "b": case "c":
				decodedString = 2;
				break;
			case "d": case "e": case "f":
				decodedString = 3;
				break;
			case "g": case "h": case "i":
				decodedString = 4;
				break;
			case "j": case "k": case "l":
				decodedString = 5;
				break;
			case "m": case "n": case "o":
				decodedString = 6;
				break;
			case "p": case "q": case "r": case "s":
				decodedString = 7;
				break;
			case "t": case "u": case "v":
				decodedString = 8;
				break;
			case "w": case "x": case "y": case "z":
				decodedString = 9;
				break;
			default:
				decodedString = inputPhoneNumber.substring(i, i + 1);
				break;
		}
		
		integerPhoneNumber += decodedString;
	}
	
	return integerPhoneNumber;
}

POST ACTIVITY THOUGHTS:

I'm very curious as to what other edabit programmers have submitted, but because I'm not a paid subscriber I can't see their solutions.
I feel as though this does a pretty good job of decoding the inputPhoneNumber String, though I don't think I'd use it to go through a phonebook
as it is. It passed the JUnit test of 6 test cases in .1 seconds, which was... fine... but I can only imagine that going through
a few dozen/hundred phone numbers would be significantly slower. I'm not sure how much of the .1 second was dedicated to JUnit overhead, but still.

Also, I've had the "867-5309" jingle and "(800) 588-2300" jingle in my head this whole time, so here's hoping this final commit commits those
tunes to someplace out of mind.
