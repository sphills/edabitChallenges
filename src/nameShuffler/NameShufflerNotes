ACTIVITY NOTES FOR:

https://edabit.com/challenge/8WBpaPzLP7piuHNeR

PROMPT:

Create a method that accepts a string (of a person's first and last name) and returns a string with the first and last name swapped.

ELEMENTS:

1) String
2) String delimiter
3) String.split()

MY THOUGHTS:

I'll make a function nameShuffle(String fullName) that parses the string with space as the delimiter, stores a String firstName and String lastName,
then returns a String newFullName.

PROTOTYPE:

public String nameShuffle(String fullName) {

	String firstName = "";
	String lastName = "";
	String[] splitFullName = fullName.split(" ");
	firstName = splitFullName[0];
	lastName = splitLastName[1];
	
	return  lastName + " " + firstName;
}

POST ACTIVITY THOUGHTS:

This was a light practice in manipulating Strings, and I felt pretty comfortable doing it. There's no validation, and it's hardcoded with the assumption
that there'll only be two elements in the fullName variable, so it's not very accommodating of multiple names, but it does what the prompt requested.
Going through other's solutions, it looks like it could be made even more concise than what I've come to, but I think this is a good balance of
brevity and readability.
