PROMPT:

Create a method that accepts a string (of a person's first and last name) and returns a string with the first and last name swapped.

ELEMENTS:

1) String
2) String delimiter
3) String.split()

MY THOUGHTS:

I'll make a function nameShuffle(String fullName) that parses the string with space as the delimiter, stores a String firstName and String lastName,
then returns a String newFullName.

PROTOTYPE:

public String nameShuffle(String fullName) {

	String firstName = "";
	String lastName = "";
	String[] splitFullName = fullName.split(" ");
	firstName = splitFullName[0];
	lastName = splitLastName[1];
	
	return  lastName + " " + firstName;
}
