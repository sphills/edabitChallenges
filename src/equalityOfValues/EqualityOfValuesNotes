PROMPT:

Create a function that takes three integer arguments (a, b, c) and returns the amount of integers which are of equal value.

Examples:
	equal(3, 4, 3) ➞ 2

	equal(1, 1, 1) ➞ 3

	equal(3, 4, 1) ➞ 0

Notes:
	Your function must return 0, 2 or 3.

ELEMENTS:

1) public int equal(int a, int b, int c){}
2) int returnInt
3) Relational Operator ==
4) Ternary Operator ? :

MY THOUGHTS:

Use == to compare a and b, then b and c.

	UPDATE:
	I realized that I forgot to test for a == c in the else {}, so it doesn't return the correct number if a == c && a != b

PROTOTYPE:

public int equal(int a, int b, int c) {

	int returnInt = 0;

	if (a == b) {
		returnInt = (b == c) ? 3: 2;
		
	} else {
		returnInt = (b == c) ? 2: 0; 
	}
	
	return returnInt;
}

POST ACTIVITY THOUGHTS:

I'm nowhere near experienced enough to say that my final function can't be reduced any further (other than deleting whitespace),
but it's pretty trim. Readable at a glance? No. Concise? Yes.

I was browsing the other solutions and came across this:

		public int equal(int a, int b, int c) {
			int count = 0;
			if (a == b){
				count++;
			}
			if (b == c){
				count++;
			}
			if (a == c){
				count++;
			}
			if (count == 1)
			{
	      	count = 2;
	    	}
			return count;
		}
		
which makes sense and is very easily read, but doesn't take advantage of any of the interesting operators. I don't really like the
if (count == 1) block, but it passes the unit tester...
