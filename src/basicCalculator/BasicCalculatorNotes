Basic Calculator notes:

https://edabit.com/challenge/gyfsGx7KrGLscxFrD

PROMPT:

Create a function that takes two numbers and a mathematical operator + - / * and will perform a calculation with the given numbers.

ELEMENTS:

1) Calculator class with calculator(int firstInt, String operator, int secondInt) method that returns int
2) String to operator parser? switch (operator)?

MY THOUGHTS:

At first I was thinking that the way it wanted the method to run was to change the operator String directly into an expression,
but now I realize I can probably just use a switch and get the same result.

PROTOTYPE:

public Class BasicCalculator{
	public int calculator(int firstInputInt, String operator, int secondInputInt) {
		int firstInt = firstInputInt;
		int secondInt = secondInputInt;
		int answer = 0;
		
		switch (operator) {
			case "+":
				answer = (firstInt + secondInt);
				break;
			case "-":
				answer = (firstInt - secondInt);
				break;
			case "*":
				answer = (firstInt(secondInt));
				break;
			case "/":
				if (firstInt/secondInt == 0){
					sysout("Divide by 0 error");
				} else {
				answer = (firstInt/secondInt);
		
		return ;
	} 
}
