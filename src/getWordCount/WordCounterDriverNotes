ACTIVITY NOTES FOR:

https://edabit.com/challenge/5LnycSd2xT4uwZCpi

PROMPT:

Create a method that takes a string and returns the word count. The string will be a sentence.

ELEMENTS:

1) public int countWords(String inputSentence){}
2) String delimiter

MY THOUGHTS:

It's been a while since I used a String delimiter, so this one is going to have to be open-book 

PROTOTYPE:

public int countWords(String inputSentence){

	String[] sentenceWords = inputSentence.split(" ");
	
	return String[].length;
}

POST ACTIVITY THOUGHTS:

I feel pretty good about this activity, but like there's an opportunity to miscount possibly. Of course,
the top-voted solution is even more code golf than mine, but seems to work just fine:

	"public static int countWords(String s) { return s.split(" ").length; }"
	
	And the second top-voted solution seems possibly over-engineered, but I like it:
	
	"public static int countWords(String s) {
      int count = 0;
      for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++)
      {
        if (s.charAt(i) == ' ')
          count++;
      }
      return count + 1;
    }"
    
All-in-all, a little simple but I feel better for it.
