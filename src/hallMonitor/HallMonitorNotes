PROMPT:

A floor plan is arranged as follows:

Four rooms, which all lead into the hallway.
It's impossible to move between rooms without first going into the hallway.

Create a function which validates whether the path between rooms is possible. The hallway will be given as the letter "H".

ELEMENTS:

1) Arrays
2) For loop
3) public boolean possiblePath(int[] inputArray)

MY THOUGHTS:

The prompt doesn't lay out many specifics, just that "It's impossible to move between rooms without first going into the hallway."
There's no other expectations or boundaries laid out, so first I'll define some here:

	1) An input array of length 1 will always return true, as you can stay in the room you are currently in.
	2) An input array of length >= 2 that doesn't contain H or the same room will always return false: you can't move from room 1 to 2
		as their only connection is the hallway.
	3) If array[i] != H && array[i + 1] != H, then possiblePath will return false. The entire sequence is not possible, even if 
		other moves before or after i and i + 1 in the array are possible.
