PROMPT:

	YouTube currently displays a like and a dislike button, allowing you to express your opinions about particular content.
	It's set up in such a way that you cannot like and dislike a video at the same time.
	
	There are two other interesting rules to be noted about the interface:
	
	1) Pressing a button, which is already active, will undo your press.
	2) If you press the like button after pressing the dislike button, the like button overwrites the previous "dislike" state.
	   The same is true for the other way round. 
	
	Create a function that takes an array of button inputs and returns the final state.

	Examples:
		likeOrDislike(["Dislike"]) ➞ "Dislike"
		
		likeOrDislike(["Like", "Like"]) ➞ "Nothing"
		
		likeOrDislike(["Dislike", "Like"]) ➞ "Like"
		
		likeOrDislike(["Like", "Dislike", "Dislike"]) ➞ "Nothing"
		
	Notes:
		If no button is currently active, return "Nothing".
		If the array is empty, return "Nothing".

ELEMENTS:

1) public String likeOrDislike(String[] inputCommands)
2) method variable String lastButtonPress
3) for loop

MY THOUGHTS:

We'll assume that each function call is a new 'video' the user is visiting. Since this is merely a function challenge and not a class challenge,
there'll be no variable in a scope higher than the function. Since there's no way to save the state in the function between calls,
we're just testing that it responds to the input array correctly, not responds to each array in sequence. 

PROTOTYPE:

public String likeOrDislike(String[] inputCommands) {

	String lastButton = "";
	
	if (!inputCommands.length > 1) {
		for (int i = 0; i < inputCommands.length; i++) {
			if (inputCommands[i].equals(lastButton)) {
				lastButton = "Nothing";
			} else {
				lastButton = inputCommands[i]; 
			}
		}
	} else {
		lastButton = inputCommands[0];
	}
	
	return lastButton;
}
