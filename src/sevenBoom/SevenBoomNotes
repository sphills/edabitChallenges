PROMPT:

Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return "Boom!" if the digit 7 appears in the array. Otherwise, return "there is no 7 in the array".

	Examples:
		sevenBoom([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]) ➞ "Boom!"
		// 7 contains the number seven.
		
		sevenBoom([8, 6, 33, 100]) ➞ "there is no 7 in the array"
		// None of the items contain 7 within them.
		
		sevenBoom([2, 55, 60, 97, 86]) ➞ "Boom!"
		// 97 contains the number seven.


ELEMENTS:

1) public static String sevenBoom(int[] inputArray)
2) nested for loop
3) String.valueOf(int inputInt)

MY THOUGHTS:

Given an array of integers, run a for loop and see if any of them are 7 itself. Then, run a for loop throughout and
convert each value from int to String. If String.length > 1, loop through the string, converting from String to int and comparing the values
to 7. Break if a 7 is found.
